# Placeholdem

#### Placeholder Animation and Polyfill

- **Version:** v0.0.2
- **Date:** 2014-02-08

Placeholdem doubles as a placeholder focus/blur animation and polyfill. The placeholder value will incrementally delete on focus, and incrementally restore on blur. That is, of course, if no value was entered by the user.
